Shared coprocessor framework configuration
==========================================

Any device with the property "xen,coproc" set will be owned by SCF and will not
be directly exposed to Dom0. "xen,coproc" property is only meaningful for a
system device tree which is passed to XEN.

Any device with the property "xen,vcoproc" will be processed by SCF to create
a virtual coprocessor. If succeed, the device will be injected in the domain's
device tree with that property wiped. The property value is a stringified path
or an alias (from a system device tree)  of a physical coproc device the virtual
coprocessor will run on. That physical coprocessor device node has to be marked
with "xen,coproc" property.
"xen,vcoproc" property is meaningful for both a system device tree and DomU's
partial device trees.
